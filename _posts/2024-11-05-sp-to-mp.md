## Initial imports

* SP maps are like MP maps, as they're stored in archive files (VPKs located in `Titanfall/vpk` directory)
* Once you found the VPK matching the SP level you wanna recycle in your MP mod, you have to open it using Harmony (link) and extract several subfolders:
    * `maps/` contains:
        * the BSP file - map file?
        * entity files - holding coordinates, model names and other information related to the objects that are spawned in the levels, doors for instance
        * navmeshes (short for navigation meshes), used by NPCs to determine where they can go on the map
    * `models/` contains the "shape" of all elements of the map, including NPCs;
    * `materials` containes the textures/skins that are applied to models.

> Screenshot without models (showing ERROR models everywhere)
> Screenshot without materials (entities glowing pink)
> Screenshot with models+materials

### Rewritten features

* Respawning system + checkpoints
* Rewrite SP code (eg don't trigger dome combat scenario, but rather extract spectres/reapers spawning logic, so it can be used as you intend it)

### SP imported features

* Objective UI
* Sound system (playing dialogues + music)
* Level intro

### New needed features

* "Gather" feature

## Future works

1. Polishing content
2. Reducing files size (stripping what isn't needed / reusing SP files directly in the future?)
3. Optimize (eg remove entities not needed)
