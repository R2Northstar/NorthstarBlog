<p>Northstar allows people to replace some of the in-game existing models (be it pilots, titans or weapons) with imported

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>As you saw in the previous section, skin modding is possible for a few months now, thanks to the hard work of our developers and as next milestone we’re now working on importing new maps in game:</p>
