<h1 id="parkour">Parkour</h1>

<p><a href="/blog/parkour-tournament/">This year again</a>, we organized a Parkour tournament, where players could compete on different maps to go through all checkpoints in the shortest amount of time.</p>

<p>For this occasion, the mod was updated with several features, including map voting and fine-grained route configuration, plus a lot of bug fixes.
Full changelog is <a href="https://github.com/Alystrasz/Alystrasz.Parkour/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">available here</a>.</p>

During 2024, progress has been made on: several features, such as mod auto-downloading; a lot of bug fixes were integrated; refactoring the code base to clean it. A massive and sincere thank you to all contributors and players. Parkour This year again, we organized a Parkour tournament, where players could compete on different maps to go through all checkpoints in the shortest amount of time. For this occasion, the mod was updated with several features, including map voting and fine-grained route configuration, plus a lot of bug fixes. Full changelog is available here. To celebrate Northstar’s birthday, we were lucky enough to have two different trailers, one from Smurfson and another from P3NG00N, check them out: Tournament results Warm-up (Deck) Example route from flag_bullettrain Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.

<p>While progress is being made on custom maps, some other maps are already waiting to be used: I’m talking about the singleplayer campaign map.
But how hard is it to use those to create multiplayer maps?</p>

<p>Here’s a little post about this little development adventure.</p>

<h3 id="initial-imports">Initial imports</h3>

<p>First of all, yes, singleplayer maps are just like multiplayer maps, as they’re stored in archive files (VPKs located in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Titanfall/vpk</code> directory).
They are stored under the form of VPK archives, that you can explore with tools like <a href="https://github.com/harmonytf/HarmonyVPKTool">Harmony</a>.</p>

<p>Once you found the VPK matching the SP level you wanna recycle in your MP mod, you can open it and extract several subfolders:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maps/</code> contains:
    <ul>
      <li>the BSP file - map central file (I guess?);</li>
      <li>entity files - holding coordinates, model names and other information related to the objects that are spawned in the levels, doors for instance;</li>
      <li>navmeshes (short for navigation meshes), used by NPCs to determine where they can go on the map;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">models/</code> contains the “shape” of all elements of the map, including NPCs;</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">materials</code> containes textures/skins that are applied to models.</li>
</ul>

<style>
.video_legend {
  font-size: 0.8em;
  font-style: italic;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: -15px !important;
}
</style>

<p style="display:flex;justify-content:center">
    <img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/sp-to-mp/plasma_railgun_charge_col.png" alt="A texture file made of white, grey and black features." />
</p>
<p class="video_legend">
  The texture file for the plasma railgun turret.
</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/sp-to-mp/import_1.png" alt="Screenshot of a level with no models, with ERROR written everywhere." /></p>
<p class="video_legend">
  With missing models and textures, the level is really ugly.
  <br />
  (the "ERROR" message means a model file is missing)
</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/sp-to-mp/import_2.png" alt="Models have been imported, but some textures glow in pink." /></p>
<p class="video_legend">
  After importing models, things look nicer! Some textures are still missing, though (note the pink texture around the sky panels).

<p class="video_legend">
  Final result, after importing models and materials.
</p>

<h3 id="rewritten-features">Rewritten features</h3>

<p>Some features cannot be directly extracted from SP levels, but must be recreated.</p>

<p>This includes the respawning system for instance: SP contains a checkpoint system that saves player’s level progression in some particular places,
allowing them to respawn close to where they died, and restore level to a given state (respawning NPC soldiers for instance); it’s obviously something
you don’t want in a MP level, as you’d probably prefer using the traditional MP spawnpoints system.</p>

<p>Additionally, some SP features cannot be reused <em>as-is</em>, but must be extracted: as an example, for boomtown, the dome combat scenario is triggered
when you enter the dome via the Ash-led platform; I prefer not doing that, but rather extracting the spectres + reapers spawning code, so it can be 
used to spawn them in waves.</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, the cage used to deliver Militia soldiers in the SP level can be used for the intro of the level.</p>

<h3 id="sp-imported-features">SP-imported features</h3>

<p style="display:flex;justify-content:center">
    <img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/sp-to-mp/objective.png" alt="Objective interface displaying the objective 'Shut up and grab a gun'." />
</p>
<p class="video_legend">
  If you played the campaign, you might have seen this interface element previously!
  It will be very useful to guide players.
</p>

<p>I also like the scripted intro of SP levels, and implemented one for the level:</p>

<script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

<h3 id="new-needed-features">New needed features</h3>

<p>To create a functional mod, you cannot only recycle code from SP levels, but also have to write some yourself from scratch.</p>

<p>One feature that immediately came to mind was the “Gather” feature, that allows developers to make sure all players reached a given location in the level before
triggering some action; you might have seen that in other games (in Overwatch’s Archives event for instance).</p>

<h2 id="future-works">Future works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I would love this level to be as close to the polished single-player experience we all know as possible: this requires using SP components (objective UI for
instance) to communicate with the player, putting a lot of attention on all details… lots of time and playtesting are needed!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also have to find a way to reduce the mod size. Currently, all models/materials from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Into the Abyss</code> mission are imported, making my mod 1.2GB big;
even if more and more people have access to a fiber Internet connection, this is not the case for all players: I shall seek for unused assets and/or
dig into the possibility of reusing SP files directly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but not least, in-game content can also be optimized: for instance, the server currently spawns soldiers and props on the “town manufacturing line”
part of the level, even if players never visit this part in my mode.</p>
  </li>

I am EnderBoy9217 and here I will share with you the process of creating one of Northstar’s most recognizable mods, Grunt Mode 2.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>

<p>My friends and I have had this idea of this style of gameplay for a while.
While we enjoy the fast pace of Titanfall, we also like the slower pace and more tactical gameplay of games like Battlefield or Squad at times, where instead of being a powerhouse, or a literal Titan, you were just another expendable soldier on the battlefield.
Gamemodes like Titanfall 2’s Attrition mode captured the chaos of the large-scale battles seen in these other games, however, it failed to fully immerse you into these as simply another soldier.</p>

<h3 id="grunt-mode-1">Grunt Mode [1]</h3>

<p>Many people have asked where the “2” in Grunt Mode 2 came from.
The reason is that the initial creation of the Grunt Mode was not my own, but instead created by another modder on the platform, VoyageDB.</p>

<p>VoyageDB’s new <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/northstar/p/VoyageDB_Modding_Home/Grunt_Mode/">Grunt Mode</a> gained massive popularity soon after its initial release.
It featured an Attrition match with more enemy types, including AI Titans, prowlers, and gunships, spawning in droppods, and best of all, everyone had the same grunt models and skins.
It took many measures to slow down the gameplay, not only through the inclusion of new AI, but also through removing boosts, player titans, double jump, limiting wallrun distance, and later removing weapon attachments.
This mode also introduced the start of the classes mechanic, where you had a small chance to spawn with either two ticks that turned into your own personal plasma drones, or a shield captain’s mobile shield.
Further it featured care packages, which would occasionally land and give out weapons pre-fitted with attachments.</p>

<h3 id="modding-a-mod">Modding a mod</h3>
<p>I had been part of the Northstar community since the first day it launched, and since then I made a few small mods and customizations, such as bringing back the singleplayer zoom functionality of the double-take.
After I had tried the new gamemode with my friends, I had decided to start customizing VoyageDB’s grunt mode (which was version 1.4.2 at the time).
I wanted to change the mod to bring players as close as possible to the AI grunts.
After some research into how Titanfall 2 grunts worked, which was tremendously helped by the <a href="https://titanfall.wiki.gg/wiki/IMC_Marine_Corps">Titanfall wiki</a>, I discovered that the AI grunts were already organized into 5 distinct classes, with in-game models and weapons assigned to each of them.
Using this knowledge, I created a spin-off mod of VoyageDB’s where, instead of spawning with your own loadout, your loadout and grunt model was determined by your class, which was randomly assigned to you each time you spawned in.
This made the gameplay significantly more grounded, as people were unable to force “meta” weapons like the CAR into every situation, and any player’s loadout could quickly be determined by simply how they looked.
This change, combined with other balance change such as the full removal of wallrunning, and a significant increase to the health of many AI units, had changed and grounded the gameplay enough that it was seen by my players as a completely different experience than VoyageDB’s, at which point I started sending copies of what would later be called “Ender’s Grunt Mode 2”.</p>

<h2 id="adding-new-features">Adding new features</h2>
<p>After establishing the mod as its own experience, I included many features that myself and other players believed would help ground the experience.
One of the first being the ability for AI to score points for their team.
While some of VoyageDB’s code comments alluded that they had attempted to do this in their own mod, this seemingly small change completely changed how the game worked.
The game was no longer a battle of players but instead a battle of teams, with each individual AI unit playing their own part. This also led to many people downloading the mod simply to play a solo experience akin to games like Ravenfield, as now it was possible to lose a match, even if you were the only player, based on your performance.</p>

<p>While I added many features, I also later removed some of VoyageDB’s work which I found didn’t fit in well with my new direction toward grounded gameplay.
I removed the care package system, removing powerful weapons such as the smart pistol out of rotation, limiting grenades, removing the ability to rodeo, and as previously mentioned, wallrunning was removed entirely.
While the intention of the limited wallrun was to allow for the climbing of walls, it felt out-of-place, and the client’s underlying visual and audio language made the intended feature feel more like a bug.
However, while most maps were almost entirely accessible through doors and stairways, many locations like rooftops were now entirely out-of-play by players, slightly reducing the amount of variety in the game.
This shortcoming was later solved with the development of the most recognizable feature of grunt mode, its new economy and class system.
New gamemodes and grunt versions of existing gamemodes like Hardpoint were also added to Grunt Mode 2 later in its development.</p>

<p>Other features of VoyageDB’s were also iterated on.
The spawning system was changed to include dropships for players, and camera angles for droppod spawns were reworked, and the exploding droppod door was re-added.
VoyageDB continued to update their own Grunt Mode mod, and the spawning zones rework in that mod was actually added to Grunt Mode 2.</p>

<p class="video_legend">

</p>

<h3 id="the-class-system-and-new-game-economy">The class system and new game economy</h3>
<p>As time went on, I developed other features into the mod.
Learning from games like Counter Strike and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, I understood that randomness killed competition.
As such, I reworked how the class system functioned, in such a way that you were able to pick your class before you spawned in.
This led to a problem, however, where, as the Specialist class had the extra ability to throw personal drones, and the Shield Captain class had an extra mobile shield, there was very little reason to pick other classes, as these were objectively better and more interesting.
Leaving these classes freely available to players, however, would severely limit the variety within a match, causing players to lean back toward being much more powerful than the average grunt.
For this reason, the new economy system was created.
At first, it simply locked these more powerful classes until you scored a certain amount of points, however, this only delayed the problem.
The economy was then changed to be similar to Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), and ironically, the old economy system was similar to the 2005 Star Wars Battlefront II, which I had also played.
Under the new economy system, the points you earned would be spent upon spawning in as these more powerful classes, forcing you to return to the main classes after you died.</p>

<p>With this new class system I had created, it became easier than ever to introduce new and balanced classes into the game.
Spectre classes were later released, with one of their key differences being the ability to double jump, intending to mimic the extreme jumps made by AI spectres.
This new ability reopened unused parts of the maps which were lost by the removal of pilot movement, and for the first time in Grunt Mode, players could become pilots again if they acquired enough points.</p>

<p>The class system was later expanded further with new classes with special unlock requirements.
Existing classes also received upgrade trees, allowing you to specialize in a specific class, making them more powerful the more you played with it.
These unlocks reset every round, however, this meant that people were spending more time in-game, experimenting with each class and what its unlocks had to offer.
The system had expanded so much that it was unreasonable to play as every single class within a single match, even with the later extended match times, much less upgrade each class to its fullest potential.
This kept replayability extremely high and helped shaped the mod from a fun gamemode that twisted Titanfall’s rules into its own experience that to many felt like an entirely different game compared to the main multiplayer, especially with the addition of the variety of grunt gamemodes.</p>

</p>

<h2 id="server-hosting-and-playtests">Server hosting and Playtests</h2>
<p>Anyone who has had the playtester role in the Northstar Discord in 2023 was constantly bombarded by the updates and changes I was making to the mod, testing the mod weekly at times.
However, as I did not have access to a 24/7 dedicated server, the playtests were really just a way to announce that a server running the mod was currently active.
Thankfully, the two largest Northstar hosts at the time, <a href="https://discord.gg/5xgB45SbQY">ikhadhonger</a> and the <a href="https://linktr.ee/untamedaxis">Untamed Axis group</a> both offered to host the mod free of charge.
I am still thankful for the time and money they spent helping to make this mod accessible to more people.
At one point, when ikhadhonger was taking a break from server hosting, Untamed Axis had three servers all running the mod to help handle the large influx of players.</p>

<p>While the outside server hosting provided access to the mod for a large number of players, the organized playtests still remained highly popular, to the point where the playtest server was consistently the Northstar server with the highest playercount.
To adjust to this popularity, the server’s settings were changed to include longer match time, higher maximum player counts, and higher AI counts.
I even enlisted the help of some community members who were some of the most active on the server, and they helped manage the server whenever it was online to prevent cheaters and ensure the server came back whenever it crashed (which was a lot).</p>

<p>I would like to thank everyone who participated in the playtests, as their feedback drastically shaped, balanced, and improved the mod to be what it is now.
Many people who participated in the playtest suggested new additions and changes through in-game chat, Discord, and in Cassius Scrungoman’s case, they reached out for help creating a <a href="https://youtu.be/XU2k-3hHpEE">video essay</a> promoting the mod and analyzing why its changes made it popular.
If you are more interested in Grunt Mode or Titanfall modding in general, I highly recommend the video and its much more lively format than this wall of text.</p>

<h2 id="the-limitations-and-roadblocks">The limitations and roadblocks</h2>
<p>One of the most difficult part of creating the mod was that I was doing many things that Titanfall 2 simply wasn’t built for.
Players were never intended to wear grunt or spectre models, and as such crashes would arise during certain actions, like rodeoing, or during the evacuation sequence.
These problems force me to create workarounds, like subtly changing models during the evacuation sequence.
Another heavy limitation was that I was dedicated to make the mod server-side only.
This meant that any player could join the game without having to download any external mods.
While this made programming some parts of the mod, especially the user interaction, exceptionally difficult, this decision greatly increased the overall accessibility and popularity of the mod.
Although Mod-Auto-Download now exists within Northstar, most of the important features are already present through server-sided means.
The only changes that I was unable to implement through this were improvements to the UI and custom viewmodels, both of which would have improved the user experience and feel of the mod, but wouldn’t cause any significant changes.</p>

<h2 id="the-continuation-of-voyagedbs-mod">The continuation of VoyageDB’s mod</h2>
<p>I would still like to recognize that VoyageDB continued to support their mod for a long time after both it and Grunt Mode 2’s release.
While VoyageDB themself has become unreachable, and the mod is currently incompatible with recent versions of Northstar, it also later introduced its own randomly spawning class system, which also began assigning players specific guns and equipment, and while it took aspects from Grunt Mode 2, VoyageDB kept their focus on making an enjoyable and more grounded spinoff of Titanfall’s original attrition mode, not shying away from giving players movement equipment like grappling hooks or stims, and not dictating any decisions based on the game’s lore.</p>

<p>Creating Grunt Mode 2 was definitely an enjoyable hobby, and I am very thankful to everyone who helped make this idea a reality.
This was my first large project, and I couldn’t have done it without the other contributors of Northstar, ikhadhonger and Untamed Zilla’s servers, the moderators of the playtesting server, and it wouldn’t have been shaped into what it is now without the feedback and analysis from Cassius, my friends, and the many community members who dedicated their time to playtesting through every single crash scenario.</p>

I am Zanieon and I have a funny and interesting story to tell about a custom gamemode for Northstar.</p>

<h2 id="how-everything-started">How everything started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Payload? What’s that Zanieon?”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for those you actually never played the other TF2 
(<a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Payload">Team Fortress 2</a>) or
<a href="https://overwatch-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Payload">Overwatch</a>
for the matter, both games have this gamemode of same name in which one team prevents the
other team from pushing a vehicle to its final destination.</p>

<p>This mode has been proven very interesting in both of those games due to the way its main
objective works and how it creates a specific dynamism in gameplay. However, Titanfall never
had said gamemode, no cut content or anything of the kind, zero clues in regards to that.</p>

<p>There have been previous attempts to make this mode in Titanfall.
Another contributor, named <a href="https://github.com/catornot"><em>cat_or_not</em></a>, tried to make it around 2022
but back at that year, the navmeshes of the maps in Northstar were very broken and many times, the NPCs
would fail to path properly.
Ever since I joined (in February 2023), my main focus was entirely on the Frontier Defense gamemode,
because my real motivation to join as a contributor was to make Frontier Defense work properly
on Northstar, which back then wasn’t also working as intended due the same reason of navmeshes and
other issues.</p>

<h2 id="payload-coming-to-reality">Payload coming to reality</h2>

<p>So, due to me dedicating an entire year of my life into making Frontier Defense work, fixing up
all problems with it and gaining experience in coding content for the game, I finally came into
realization that I could probably attempt myself at doing such Payload gamemode because I’ve
always had interest in playing said mode, despite never playing Team Fortress 2 or Overwatch
in my life.</p>

<p>Case in point, at a random day, I consulted <em>cat_or_not</em> to see how far he went with his own
version of the mode before starting anything on my own — if there was anything I could start
from — but the code wasn’t touched ever since he lost motivation to work on it due to broken
navmeshes. It was extremely bare-bones so starting from that code or building an entire new
one from scratch would take equally long.</p>

<h2 id="speedrunning-the-code">Speedrunning the code</h2>

<p>A couple days after I did this consult, I decided to start writing the gamemode entirely from
zero pratically. I had a very clear vision of what this gamemode should be and how it could be
played with its own spice of Titanfall 2 on it; so I began writing the scripts, and here comes the
funny part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><u>I was so hyped to see this thing working that I wrote the entire server and client
logic within only 2 days non-stop!</u></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! Non-stop, meaning I also haven’t slept between both days while I did that, only taking the
normal breaks any person would do (toilet, eat and drink).</p>

<p>That was actually only possible due to the entire work I did on Frontier Defense, as a
lot of functions and code was adapted from there, alongside some logic from Amped Hardpoint
gamemode too, with everything working on the basic level the way I conceptualized this mode
with the touch of Titanfall 2 over it; it even attracted the attention of the Competitive players
whose only gamemode to play is Capture The Flag.</p>

<p>Pretty much on the week that followed that happening, I did some rebalances and touches
here and there and bam, there’s this fully brand new gamemode that never existed into the
game actually fully functional now with the way it could play in Titanfall 2’s gameplay terms.
This was probably my quickest speedrun of coding anything for Northstar project given the 2 day
timespan, one does not simply drop a whole brand new gamemode that easily, but well, it was
fun doing that.</p>

<h2 id="the-gamemode">The gamemode</h2>

<p>The objective for the attacking team is to lead a Nuclear titan to the Harvester of the opposing
team, to hopefully destroy it; the defending team must prevent this happening to secure the win!
Like Team Fortress and Overwatch, the more attacking players around the Titan, the faster it is.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/payload/defense.png" alt="Pilots hide behind a shield from attackers and incoming Titan" /></p>

<p>Now for the Titanfall touch:</p>
<ul>
  <li>defending team can steal batteries from the Titan to reinforce their harvester’s shield (meaning
it won’t necessarily be destroyed if the Titan reaches it and triggers its nuclear explosion!);</li>
  <li>attackers can use batteries on the Titan to shield it; while it is shielded, the Titan moves
automatically, even without players being around;</li>
  <li>both Titan and harvester shields can be damaged with conventional weapons.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-mad">What is MAD?</h3>

<p>MAD is an acronym that stands for <em>mod auto-downloading</em>; the idea of the feature is for your game to download
mods required by the server as you join it.
Some games are known to integrate this feature, like Counter-Strike or Team Fortress.</p>

<p>On Northstar, currently, when joining a server requiring client-side mods, you will be displayed this message:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/mad-progress/missing-mod.png" alt="Screenshot of the missing mod interface when joining a server" /></p>

<p>This breaks your user experience since it forces you to go download the mod by yourself on the Internet (in practice,
you won’t look for the missing mod, and just join another server).</p>

<hr />

<p>I’ve been working on this feature for two years (first commit on <a href="https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarLauncher/pull/262/commits/114653052972383f9b154d96c581a2b90c483c87">Aug. 30th, 2022</a>), and progress is slow since there is much to be taken into
consideration here: according to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git-hours</code>, I invested at least 258 hours in the launcher part and 197 hours in the
scripting part.
Progress is nonetheless being made: you might have noticed that we did some <em>production testing</em>
of the feature earlier this year through the <a href="/blog/parkour-tournament">Parkour tournament</a> we organised.</p>

<p>Let’s now check where we are on the development of MAD.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-done">What is done?</h3>

<h4 id="verification-system">Verification system</h4>

<p>Don’t worry, Northstar is <em>not</em> going to download malware stuff to your computer! We have a verification system
to avoid doing that.</p>

<p>Basically, your game can only download mods that went through a verification process described here:
<a href="https://github.com/R2Northstar/VerifiedMods">https://github.com/R2Northstar/VerifiedMods</a>;
this process includes mod source code being public and release upload be automatic (by the way, if you want your
gamemode to be auto-downloadable, don’t hesitate to submit a request in the aforementioned repository!)</p>

<p>Even though it can always be improved, this verification system is functional and currently supports 5 mods for
auto-downloading.</p>

<h4 id="downloading-mods">Downloading mods</h4>

<p>The implementation of this mod auto-downloading feature within Northstar was done in the two Northstar core components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarLauncher"><strong>NorthstarLauncher</strong></a> native code (C++) is responsible for low-level calls: think file system access, mod archive fetching etc.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarMods"><strong>NorthstarMods</strong></a> script part (Squirrel VM) invokes native methods and updates UI accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the basic steps of the downloading process, when joining a server requiring mods you don’t locally have:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Retrieve the list of verified mods from GitHub;</li>
  <li>Ensure missing mod can be downloaded;</li>
  <li>Download missing mod archive file;</li>
  <li>Ensure archive is not corrupted;</li>
  <li>Extract mod archive to current player profile;</li>
  <li>Reload mods to add downloaded mod to local mods collection;</li>
  <li>Server can be joined.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see on the video below, mod downloading actually works™.</p>

<h3 id="whats-left-to-be-done">What’s left to be done?</h3>

<p>So, why isn’t MAD public yet?</p>

<p>Actually, it is deployed, but shielded behind a configuration variable (you have to type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allow_mod_auto_download 1</code>
in your console to enable it) because we feel like some stuff is missing:</p>

<h4 id="assets-reloading-mad-only-working-for-gamemodes-and-basic-maps">Assets reloading (mad only working for gamemodes and basic maps)</h4>

<p>Currently, the game is not able to reload assets (sounds for instance) without restarting, it means that if
you download a mod including sound assets through MAD, your game will just crash.</p>

<h4 id="mod-versions">Mod versions</h4>

<p>If you join a server requiring <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1.1.0</code> of a given mod but you already have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1.0.0</code> installed, the game should
disable your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1.0.0</code> version, and install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1.1.0</code> through MAD; the problem is that the game is currently not
able to distinguish between multiple versions of a same mod: mod handling code has to be rewritten to take mod
versions into account.</p>

<h6 id="example">Example</h6>

<p>Currently, to enable the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Parkour</code> mod, you would have to call the following function:</p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">NSSetModEnabled</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Parkour</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this won’t work if you have several versions of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Parkour</code> mod installed.
To fix that, the idea is to add a “version” parameter to the game interface, as such:</p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">NSSetModEnabled</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Parkour</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">1.1.0</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To celebrate two years of existence, we decided to organize a competition between all players to see who’s the fastest:
this blog post tells the story of the <a href="https://github.com/Alystrasz/Alystrasz.Parkour">Parkour mod</a>’s origin and
development, and showcases results of this first Parkour tournament.</p>

<h3 id="developer-story">Developer story</h3>

<h4 id="origin-of-the-mod">Origin of the mod</h4>

<p>When I was younger, I loved going to my friends’ houses, set up a local network, and play some LAN games. These games
included Counter Strike 1.6, Warcraft 3, and <a href="https://www.trackmania.com/?lang=en">Trackmania</a>; if you don’t know the
last, it’s a car game where you have to reach a finish line, crossing a set of checkpoints as fast as you can (rings a
bell, right?).</p>

<p>I also spend lots of (probably more than I should) time on World of Warcraft, whose latest expansion, named Dragonflight,
released a similar feature dubbed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gr4rZXPw6w">“Dragonriding races”</a>.</p>

<p>At some point, I thought: “That would be a great mod idea for Northstar!”. I would call it <em>“Parkour”</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/parkour/parkour.gif" alt="The Office's Michael Scott doing parkour." /></p>

<h4 id="development">Development</h4>

<p>Since developing this mod basically resolved to develop a multiplayer version of the single-player 
<a href="https://titanfall.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pilot's_Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> mission, I could reuse a lot of assets from it,
including starting/finish lines visuals, speed indicator and scoreboards.
For other entities I had to improvise: for instance, the model used for checkpoints is actually a Titan shield, colored
in green :)</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/parkour/checkpoint.gif" alt="Parkour checkpoint using the Titan shield model, colored in green" /></p>

<p>Initial development of the mod only included a local scoreboard, where you could see scores of players in the current
match; we then thought it would be cool to have a way to save your personal best time for each map, which led me to
develop a scoring server to save scores for all players in all maps, and an associated web scoreboard, to maintain
competition between players:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/parkour/global-scoreboard.png" alt="Screenshot of the Parkour tournament web scoreboard" /></p>

<p>Once the scoring server was set up, I deployed Parkour servers in Europe, North America and Australia during twelve days,
which led to 367 players scoring a time on a map (maybe more tried, but couldn’t finish a route? We’ll never know).</p>

<h4 id="feedback">Feedback</h4>

<p>We received <em>a lot</em> of feedback about Parkour which gave us lots of ideas to improve it for the next tournament, and I
thank you all for that.</p>

<p>This Parkour tournament was also a good opportunity to test <em>mod auto-downloading</em> in live conditions, if you’re curious
about this feature, I wrote <a href="https://remyraes.com/autodownload.html">another blog post</a> describing it in details.</p>

<h3 id="media">Media</h3>

<p>To celebrate Northstar’s second birthday and the parkour tournament, we asked the community some help with trailers, and
got an amazing one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@P3NG00Nlol">P3NG00N</a>:</p>

<p>We were also lucky enough to have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@evanboymelviper">Evan Boymel</a>, voice actor of Viper,
make a voice-over for another trailer from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dionysus9517">Dionysus9517</a>:</p>

<h3 id="closing-words">Closing words</h3>

<p>I was really surprised seeing the Titanfall 2 speedrunning community, including <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2028529918">Dadadu2711</a>,
taking over the mod and breaking the routes I designed in ways I never heard of previously: grav star boosting, EPG
boosting… There were discussions about the best ways to improve scores; I feel like there was a good competitive
spirit within this tournament, that’s definitely something I plan to redo in the future!</p>

<p>I want to thank all players that participated in that first tournament, and all developers + play testers who helped
make this mod what it is today.</p>

<p>See you all on the Frontier!</p>

To celebrate two years of existence, we decided to organize a competition between all players to see who’s the fastest: this blog post tells the story of the Parkour mod’s origin and development, and showcases results of this first Parkour tournament. Developer story Origin of the mod When I was younger, I loved going to my friends’ houses, set up a local network, and play some LAN games. These games included Counter Strike 1.6, Warcraft 3, and Trackmania; if you don’t know the last, it’s a car game where you have to reach a finish line, crossing a set of checkpoints as fast as you can (rings a bell, right?). I also spend lots of (probably more than I should) time on World of Warcraft, whose latest expansion, named Dragonflight, released a similar feature dubbed “Dragonriding races”. At some point, I thought: “That would be a great mod idea for Northstar!”. I would call it “Parkour”. Development Since developing this mod basically resolved to develop a multiplayer version of the single-player Gauntlet mission, I could reuse a lot of assets from it, including starting/finish lines visuals, speed indicator and scoreboards. For other entities I had to improvise: for instance, the model used for checkpoints is actually a Titan shield, colored in green :) Initial development of the mod only included a local scoreboard, where you could see scores of players in the current match; we then thought it would be cool to have a way to save your personal best time for each map, which led me to develop a scoring server to save scores for all players in all maps, and an associated web scoreboard, to maintain competition between players: Once the scoring server was set up, I deployed Parkour servers in Europe, North America and Australia during twelve days, which led to 367 players scoring a time on a map (maybe more tried, but couldn’t finish a route? We’ll never know). Feedback We received a lot of feedback about Parkour which gave us lots of ideas to improve it for the next tournament, and I thank you all for that. This Parkour tournament was also a good opportunity to test mod auto-downloading in live conditions, if you’re curious about this feature, I wrote another blog post describing it in details. Media To celebrate Northstar’s second birthday and the parkour tournament, we asked the community some help with trailers, and got an amazing one from P3NG00N: We were also lucky enough to have Evan Boymel, voice actor of Viper, make a voice-over for another trailer from Dionysus9517: Associated YouTube short from Evan: Closing words I was really surprised seeing the Titanfall 2 speedrunning community, including Dadadu2711, taking over the mod and breaking the routes I designed in ways I never heard of previously: grav star boosting, EPG boosting… There were discussions about the best ways to improve scores; I feel like there was a good competitive spirit within this tournament, that’s definitely something I plan to redo in the future! I want to thank all players that participated in that first tournament, and all developers + play testers who helped make this mod what it is today. See you all on the Frontier!

Northstar is over two years old now! :O</p>

<p>For those unaware, Northstar had its first public release on the 24th of December 2021 which makes it over two years old now :eyes:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/two-years/first-release-github.png" alt="Screenshot of the first Northstar release" /></p>

<p>Now most of us tend to be busy over the Christmas Holidays so we moved the “official” anniversary to January 8th ;)</p>

<h3 id="mod-auto-download">Mod-Auto-Download</h3>

<p>With that out of the way, we wanna celebrate Northstar’s second anniversary, by giving a first preview on the Mod-Auto-Download functionality we are working on.
You may remember this from our <a href="https://youtu.be/jixxGZ-NVZo?t=78">little teaser in the Christmas trailer</a>.</p>

<p>This feature allows you to automatically download any mod (that has been verified to be secure) required by a server as you join it.
And while there are still a bunch of things to figure out and reverse in the game to allow for example custom maps and other assets to be loaded as you join a server, it already works well enough for things like custom gamemodes.</p>

<h3 id="parkour">Parkour</h3>

<p>As such we are already temporarily enabling Mod-Auto-Download in its current state to bring you the <strong>Parkour</strong> gamemode.</p>

<p>Race your friends and a global leaderboard and try to come out on top in this new mode as you go from checkpoint to checkpoint in the shortest amount of time.</p>

<p>To celebrate it, we also got not just one but two trailers highlighting the mode, check them out:</p>

Here’s what we found, how we reported it, and how it got resolved.</p>

<p>The discovered exploit allows an adversary to run any Squirrel script on the server within the bounds of Titanfall2’s commands by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> command. Usually clients should not be able to send the server Squirrel commands to execute.</p>

<p>We believe that the vulnerability was introduced in a recent server side patch given that we found a different vulnerability before in early 2022 (we reported it and saw it getting patched) that achieved a similar effect but was harder to exploit.</p>

<p>This issue was reported through EA’s Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process and was triaged and patched within 2 weeks of our initial report.</p>

<p>(And yes Respawn does still patch Titanfall2 servers for vulnerabilities. Stay tuned for more blog posts on other vulnerabilities we found on public Titanfall2 servers and reported to Respawn that then got patched.)</p>

<p><strong>Terminology:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Squirrel</em> is the scripting language used by Titanfall2.</li>
  <li><em>Squirrel VM</em>, a virtual machine for scripting that acts as an abstract binding layer between the Source engine and external scripts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>The following is a timeline of events between the discovery of the vulnerability and its fix.</p>

<h3 id="2023-01-09-1022-utc">2023-01-09 10:22 UTC</h3>

<p>As part of a discussion about Northstar in a semi-restricted Discord channel, <a href="https://github.com/zxcPandora">zxcPandora</a> finds out that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> command allows for running for Squirrel script server side on official public servers.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/pandora-discord-message.png" alt="A Discord message sent by zxcPandora when they initially discovered the vulnerability" /></p>

<p>In particular this issue was found to affect build number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8740</code> of the official public Titanfall2 dedicated servers.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/status-command.png" alt="Screenshot of status command being run against vanilla server to get affect server version number" /></p>

<p>Within half an hour we identified the severity of the exploit.</p>

<p>We immediately began archiving the entire conversation via screenshots and deleted all references to the exploit to limit exposure of the vulnerability.</p>

<p>Note that the message was posted in a semi-private channel with 100+ members. As such it was clear from the beginning that it was only a matter of time until the exploit would become public knowledge.</p>

<p>As such, shortly afterwards, Taskinoz reached out to a Respawn employee directly. We’ve been using this person as contact previously for reporting exploits.</p>

<h3 id="2023-01-09-1230-utc">2023-01-09 12:30 UTC</h3>

<p>We created a quick proof of concept using an unmodified retail Titanfall2 client which has a keybind bound to run a serverside function that switches map and mode using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GameRules_ChangeMap</code>.</p>

<p>We uploaded the clip showcasing it as an unlisted YouTube video.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d1iWAfiG33k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Note that this clip shows loading Frontier Defense on the map Glitch. This map/mode combination was however never released in the retail game as you can see by the map being locked in the map selection screen, after setting the gamemode to Frontier Defense.</p>

<p>Again loading an unreleased map/mode combination is not really a security issue per se. This clip is to simply show that the vulnerability of running arbitrary Squirrel functions server side exists. <br />
We purposefully decided not to perform any potentially damaging attacks to avoid any liability.</p>

<h3 id="2023-01-09-1340-utc">2023-01-09 13:40 UTC</h3>

<p>We sent an initial email to EA Security to inform them about the exploit.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/email-sent-initial.png" alt="Screenshot of the first email sent to EA Security" /></p>

<h3 id="2023-01-10-1504-utc">2023-01-10 15:04 UTC</h3>

<p>Per EA’s own instructions, we sent a follow up email due to a lack of response.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/email-sent-inital-followup.png" alt="Screenshot of a follow-up email sent to EA Security due to lack of response from their side" /></p>

<p>We also discovered first abuses of the vulnerability in the wild:</p>

<h3 id="2023-01-10-1828-utc">2023-01-10 18:28 UTC</h3>

<p>We received an initial response from EA saying they are investigating the issue. Do note that they asked us to keep any information regarding the issue confidential until it is resolved.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/email-recv-initial.png" alt="Screenshot of the first response we received by EA Security" /></p>

<h3 id="2023-01-14-1130-utc">2023-01-14 11:30 UTC</h3>

<p>We sent another follow up email based on new information,</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/email-sent-update-affected.png" alt="Screenshot of an email we sent to EA Security with additional information regarding affected players" /></p>

<h3 id="2023-01-17-at-1712-utc">2023-01-17 at 17:12 UTC</h3>

<p>We sent another update email to EA Security.</p>

<p>At this point it had been over a week since the initial discovery and we received no further communication from EA Security and little to no updates via our contact at Respawn. At the same time we saw more cases of the exploit being used in the wild. While the cases we saw were usually benign, e.g. someone giving themselves Titan weapons as a pilot, it was a clear indicator that the exploit started becoming public knowledge.</p>

<p>Since a proper attack is invisible to the player, we could only make guesses whether or not the exploit was being used maliciously to take control of dedicated servers.</p>

<p>As such we decided to give EA Security a deadline after which we would make an announcement that playing on vanilla servers might potentially be unsafe.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/email-sent-deadline.png" alt="Screenshot of an email we sent to EA Security due to lack of response on their side." /></p>

<h3 id="2023-01-21-825-utc">2023-01-21 8:25 UTC</h3>

<p>While checking the state of the exploit, <a href="https://d3-3109.cc/">D3-3109</a> noticed an updated server build number. Upon further investigation we were able to confirm from our side that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> no longer worked to run server side code.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/status-server-update.png" alt="A screenshot showing the different server versions together with the date when they were taken" /></p>

<h3 id="2023-01-21-at-1339-utc">2023-01-21 at 13:39 UTC</h3>

<p>As we deemed the issue fixed, we informed EA Security accordingly.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/email-sent-fixed.png" alt="Screenshot of an email we sent to EA Security as we noticed the issue resolved on our end" /></p>

<h3 id="2023-01-23-at-2023-utc">2023-01-23 at 20:23 UTC</h3>

<p>And two days later we got confirmation from EA Security that a patch was in place :D</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/email-recv-fixed.png" alt="Screenshot of the email EA Security sent back to us confirm that a fix was in place" /></p>

<h1 id="potential-attack-vectors">Potential attack vectors:</h1>

<p>Now with the timeline out of the way, let’s discuss the severity of the vulnerability. Essentially it gives full access to the servers’ Squirrel VM meaning that any Squirrel function on the server can be called and in-game data can be extracted.</p>

<p>What follows are a small set of attacks this vulnerability would have allowed for. Note that we only tested them locally using Northstar. We never tested them on the actual public Titanfall2 game servers as it could cause potential damage that we do not want to be held responsible for.</p>

<h2 id="messing-with-player-stats">Messing with player stats</h2>

<p>As the game server is able to set player stats, this vulnerability allows for arbitrarily changing player stats. In particular we observed some people trying to boost their in-game level with it. Even more so, some players would simply copy-and-paste commands commonly used to set player levels in Northstar into their console in public lobbies on public Titanfall2 servers, resulting in changing other player’s levels by accident.</p>

<p>Setting the player level too high whether by accident or on purpose is an issue as it causes the gameserver to reject the player due to incorrect player data. Essentially this means that that player is completely locked out of multiplayer.</p>

<p>When fixing the vulnerability Respawn added a workaround for this case. Now, players with a too high player level will simply show the according gen. Further the exploit allowed for unlocking all skins, banners and emblems, including the developer one. As a result of this, a player having a dev emblem does no longer indicate that they are actually a developer.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/player-fakedev1.png" alt="Screenshot of a player being above max level and having a developer batch" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/posts/vanilla-unrestricted-server-script/player-fakedev2.png" alt="Screenshot of a player being above max level and having a developer batch" /></p>

<h2 id="devtextbufferwrite--devtextbufferdumptofile">DevTextBufferWrite / DevTextBufferDumpToFile</h2>

<p>To aid in debugging, Squirrel contains a few functions intended for developers. Here we take a specific look at two of those, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DevTextBufferWrite</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DevTextBufferDumpToFile</code>.</p>

<p>Note that these functions could have been executed only against the Titanfall2 game servers, not game clients. Furthermore, the server cannot tell the client to compile/execute scripts without a remote callback registered.</p>

<p>With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DevTextBufferWrite</code> a developer can write a string to buffer and then save said buffer to a file using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DevTextBufferDumpToFile</code>. This means combining the two functions one can e.g. use</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>script DevTextBufferWrite("this is a test")
script DevTextBufferDumpToFile("abc.txt")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abc.txt</code> which contains the text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this is a test</code>.</p>

<p>Note that we are not limited to just the current folder. For the filename we can give the function any absolute pathname and as long as we have access to it, it will write the file to said path. Thankfully this function is limited to text, so we cannot use this to upload any binary file to the server.</p>

<p>However what we can do is write a script to a batch file that will then download and run a secondary payload. The only thing still preventing us is that we need a way to execute that batch file.<br />
To work around this, we could try to write it to the Windows user startup applications. This means that upon restarting the device, the file will be executed. However there’s yet another roadblock, as to write to a Windows user startup applications folder we need to know their username as it is part of the path.</p>

<p>Should we know username for some reason, all we need to do to complete the attack is to simply run</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>script DevTextBufferWrite("start \"calc.exe\"")
script DevTextBufferDumpToFile("C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\test.bat")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and upon restart our batch file is executed. In this example, it simply opens the calculator app but replacing this line with a PowerShell script to download and run a virus is all that is needed to take control of the server.</p>

<p>Note that we cannot use</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\test.bat
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>as the path as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%appdata%</code> does not get resolved at all.</p>

<p>Now given that this is about an attack on the server, the Windows user name could probably be bruteforced from a list of commonly used ones but assuming best practices, gameservers are usually set up to rebuild from a fresh image on reboot.</p>

<p>Note that again this attack would only work against Titanfall2 game servers but not against game clients.</p>

<p>For reference in Northstar, <a href="https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarLauncher/pull/211">these developer functions are blocked by default</a>.</p>

<h2 id="clientcommand">ClientCommand</h2>

<p>However, we do not even need to take full control of the gameserver to start attacking other clients.</p>

<p>What makes the vulnerability especially bad is that in the security model of Titanfall2 unlike Northstar, the dedicated server is fully trusted and due to this the client accepts any commands from the server. This is for example used to connect a client to a server during matchmaking, where essentially the server sends a ClientCommand that tells the client to connect to a specific server.</p>

<p>Note that ClientCommand cannot be used to force script execution on the client since the retail game-clients do not have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script_client</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script_ui</code> functions. As such in an attack against ClientCommand we’re limited to certain commands like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect</code>.</p>

<p>In Northstar, ClientCommand is blocked meaning the server cannot tell the client to run any command at all. This is necessary as unlike standard Titanfall2 where only Respawn is hosting dedicated servers, anyone can host a game server in Northstar so in our security model, the game server is always untrusted.</p>

<h2 id="stryder-session-token-stealing">Stryder session token stealing</h2>

<p>When connecting to a gameserver, the unmodified retail game client sends it a valid Stryder session token on connect. Presumably this is done for some kind of authentication.</p>

<p>Now using ClientCommand mentioned above, this means an attacker can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> vulnerability to force all clients in a public match to connect to a server they host themselves.</p>

<p>When the clients connect they then send the Stryder token which the attacker can then grab. With this token the attacker achieves limited access to the victim’s Titanfall2 account. The token can be used to make API calls on behalf of the victim against the Stryder Titanfall2 backend server.</p>

<p>Around October 2022 we found out about the fact of clients sending Stryder token to game server and as such <a href="https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarLauncher/pull/282">deployed a patch for Northstar that clears the token</a>, so that the client no longer send valid tokens to the gameserver. Further we restricted players to only the patched version by requiring players to update in order to play on Northstar.</p>

<p>For the official public Titanfall2 game servers this method of sending the Stryder token would technically be fine under its security model as the server is fully trusted, so sending it a valid token is not an issue. However with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> vulnerability, this trust model fell apart as suddenly an attacker could gain control of the server, making it no longer trusted.</p>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ:</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why didn’t you publicly announce that vanilla Titanfall2 servers were insecure when you found out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> We followed (and were asked by EA Security to follow) the process of <em>Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure</em>. <br />
This means that the issue is reported confidentially to the affected party, in this case Respawn/EA and information about the vulnerability are only made public once there was enough time to implement a fix.</p>

<p>Once we saw more public abuse of the exploit, we had an internal discussion about putting out a PSA to warn players about the potential of a vulnerability without disclosing how it works. Ultimately we settled on giving Respawn/EA a one week deadline. Thankfully the issue was patched before reaching the deadline and as such a PSA was no longer necessary.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> With this exploit I could have played Frontier Defense on maps where it was never released, why didn’t you tell me about this? &gt;:(</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This exploit allows for so much more than just playing unreleased map/mod combinations. As such letting anyone know about this publicly before it was patched would have been a huge security risk.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you recap again what the vulnerability was?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Titanfall2 game servers had a bug where any player could run Squirrel commands on server-side. Usually this should not happen as it completely breaks the security model of Titanfall2. This is essentially remote code execution (RCE) within the bounds of Titanfall2’s scripting language called Squirrel.</p>

<p>Congrats on making it to the end of the post. I hope you enjoyed the little tour into how we reported the script vulnerability to EA Security and Respawn, and worked with them to resolve it.
At this point I want to give a shout-out again to Respawn and EA Security for listening to us and resolving the issue.</p>

Here’s what we found, how we reported it, and how it got resolved. The discovered exploit allows an adversary to run any Squirrel script on the server within the bounds of Titanfall2’s commands by using the script command. Usually clients should not be able to send the server Squirrel commands to execute. We believe that the vulnerability was introduced in a recent server side patch given that we found a different vulnerability before in early 2022 (we reported it and saw it getting patched) that achieved a similar effect but was harder to exploit. This issue was reported through EA’s Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process and was triaged and patched within 2 weeks of our initial report. (And yes Respawn does still patch Titanfall2 servers for vulnerabilities. Stay tuned for more blog posts on other vulnerabilities we found on public Titanfall2 servers and reported to Respawn that then got patched.) Terminology: Squirrel is the scripting language used by Titanfall2. Squirrel VM, a virtual machine for scripting that acts as an abstract binding layer between the Source engine and external scripts. Timeline The following is a timeline of events between the discovery of the vulnerability and its fix. 2023-01-09 10:22 UTC As part of a discussion about Northstar in a semi-restricted Discord channel, zxcPandora finds out that the script command allows for running for Squirrel script server side on official public servers. In particular this issue was found to affect build number 8740 of the official public Titanfall2 dedicated servers. Within half an hour we identified the severity of the exploit. We immediately began archiving the entire conversation via screenshots and deleted all references to the exploit to limit exposure of the vulnerability. Note that the message was posted in a semi-private channel with 100+ members. As such it was clear from the beginning that it was only a matter of time until the exploit would become public knowledge. As such, shortly afterwards, Taskinoz reached out to a Respawn employee directly. We’ve been using this person as contact previously for reporting exploits. 2023-01-09 12:30 UTC We created a quick proof of concept using an unmodified retail Titanfall2 client which has a keybind bound to run a serverside function that switches map and mode using GameRules_ChangeMap. We uploaded the clip showcasing it as an unlisted YouTube video. Note that this clip shows loading Frontier Defense on the map Glitch. This map/mode combination was however never released in the retail game as you can see by the map being locked in the map selection screen, after setting the gamemode to Frontier Defense. Again loading an unreleased map/mode combination is not really a security issue per se. This clip is to simply show that the vulnerability of running arbitrary Squirrel functions server side exists. We purposefully decided not to perform any potentially damaging attacks to avoid any liability. 2023-01-09 13:40 UTC We sent an initial email to EA Security to inform them about the exploit. 2023-01-10 15:04 UTC Per EA’s own instructions, we sent a follow up email due to a lack of response. We also discovered first abuses of the vulnerability in the wild: 2023-01-10 18:28 UTC We received an initial response from EA saying they are investigating the issue. Do note that they asked us to keep any information regarding the issue confidential until it is resolved. 2023-01-14 11:30 UTC We sent another follow up email based on new information, with the following attachments (The linked post from the email: https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/10awcv8/i_have_now_become_a_top_pilot/) 2023-01-17 at 17:12 UTC We sent another update email to EA Security. At this point it had been over a week since the initial discovery and we received no further communication from EA Security and little to no updates via our contact at Respawn. At the same time we saw more cases of the exploit being used in the wild. While the cases we saw were usually benign, e.g. someone giving themselves Titan weapons as a pilot, it was a clear indicator that the exploit started becoming public knowledge. Since a proper attack is invisible to the player, we could only make guesses whether or not the exploit was being used maliciously to take control of dedicated servers. As such we decided to give EA Security a deadline after which we would make an announcement that playing on vanilla servers might potentially be unsafe. 2023-01-21 8:25 UTC While checking the state of the exploit, D3-3109 noticed an updated server build number. Upon further investigation we were able to confirm from our side that script no longer worked to run server side code. 2023-01-21 at 13:39 UTC As we deemed the issue fixed, we informed EA Security accordingly. 2023-01-23 at 20:23 UTC And two days later we got confirmation from EA Security that a patch was in place :D Potential attack vectors: Now with the timeline out of the way, let’s discuss the severity of the vulnerability. Essentially it gives full access to the servers’ Squirrel VM meaning that any Squirrel function on the server can be called and in-game data can be extracted. What follows are a small set of attacks this vulnerability would have allowed for. Note that we only tested them locally using Northstar. We never tested them on the actual public Titanfall2 game servers as it could cause potential damage that we do not want to be held responsible for. Messing with player stats As the game server is able to set player stats, this vulnerability allows for arbitrarily changing player stats. In particular we observed some people trying to boost their in-game level with it. Even more so, some players would simply copy-and-paste commands commonly used to set player levels in Northstar into their console in public lobbies on public Titanfall2 servers, resulting in changing other player’s levels by accident. Setting the player level too high whether by accident or on purpose is an issue as it causes the gameserver to reject the player due to incorrect player data. Essentially this means that that player is completely locked out of multiplayer. When fixing the vulnerability Respawn added a workaround for this case. Now, players with a too high player level will simply show the according gen. Further the exploit allowed for unlocking all skins, banners and emblems, including the developer one. As a result of this, a player having a dev emblem does no longer indicate that they are actually a developer. DevTextBufferWrite / DevTextBufferDumpToFile To aid in debugging, Squirrel contains a few functions intended for developers. Here we take a specific look at two of those, DevTextBufferWrite and DevTextBufferDumpToFile. Note that these functions could have been executed only against the Titanfall2 game servers, not game clients. Furthermore, the server cannot tell the client to compile/execute scripts without a remote callback registered. With DevTextBufferWrite a developer can write a string to buffer and then save said buffer to a file using DevTextBufferDumpToFile. This means combining the two functions one can e.g. use script DevTextBufferWrite("this is a test") script DevTextBufferDumpToFile("abc.txt") to create a file called abc.txt which contains the text this is a test. Note that we are not limited to just the current folder. For the filename we can give the function any absolute pathname and as long as we have access to it, it will write the file to said path. Thankfully this function is limited to text, so we cannot use this to upload any binary file to the server. However what we can do is write a script to a batch file that will then download and run a secondary payload. The only thing still preventing us is that we need a way to execute that batch file. To work around this, we could try to write it to the Windows user startup applications. This means that upon restarting the device, the file will be executed. However there’s yet another roadblock, as to write to a Windows user startup applications folder we need to know their username as it is part of the path. Should we know username for some reason, all we need to do to complete the attack is to simply run script DevTextBufferWrite("start \"calc.exe\"") script DevTextBufferDumpToFile("C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\test.bat") and upon restart our batch file is executed. In this example, it simply opens the calculator app but replacing this line with a PowerShell script to download and run a virus is all that is needed to take control of the server. Note that we cannot use %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\test.bat as the path as %appdata% does not get resolved at all. Now given that this is about an attack on the server, the Windows user name could probably be bruteforced from a list of commonly used ones but assuming best practices, gameservers are usually set up to rebuild from a fresh image on reboot. Note that again this attack would only work against Titanfall2 game servers but not against game clients. For reference in Northstar, these developer functions are blocked by default. ClientCommand However, we do not even need to take full control of the gameserver to start attacking other clients. What makes the vulnerability especially bad is that in the security model of Titanfall2 unlike Northstar, the dedicated server is fully trusted and due to this the client accepts any commands from the server. This is for example used to connect a client to a server during matchmaking, where essentially the server sends a ClientCommand that tells the client to connect to a specific server. Note that ClientCommand cannot be used to force script execution on the client since the retail game-clients do not have the script_client/script_ui functions. As such in an attack against ClientCommand we’re limited to certain commands like connect. In Northstar, ClientCommand is blocked meaning the server cannot tell the client to run any command at all. This is necessary as unlike standard Titanfall2 where only Respawn is hosting dedicated servers, anyone can host a game server in Northstar so in our security model, the game server is always untrusted. Stryder session token stealing When connecting to a gameserver, the unmodified retail game client sends it a valid Stryder session token on connect. Presumably this is done for some kind of authentication. Now using ClientCommand mentioned above, this means an attacker can use the script vulnerability to force all clients in a public match to connect to a server they host themselves. When the clients connect they then send the Stryder token which the attacker can then grab. With this token the attacker achieves limited access to the victim’s Titanfall2 account. The token can be used to make API calls on behalf of the victim against the Stryder Titanfall2 backend server. Around October 2022 we found out about the fact of clients sending Stryder token to game server and as such deployed a patch for Northstar that clears the token, so that the client no longer send valid tokens to the gameserver. Further we restricted players to only the patched version by requiring players to update in order to play on Northstar. For the official public Titanfall2 game servers this method of sending the Stryder token would technically be fine under its security model as the server is fully trusted, so sending it a valid token is not an issue. However with the script vulnerability, this trust model fell apart as suddenly an attacker could gain control of the server, making it no longer trusted.
